# main program
#------------------------------------------------------------
The main program includes two perl scripts and one R script
1. BFAC_build_20131206.pl # for bulding bloom filter
	- BFAC_build_20131206.sh # command line run for 1, 
							 # please check correctness of relative file path
							 # input (reference genomes) are also included here
2. BFAC_query_20131206.pl # FOR query bloom filter
	- BFAC_query_20131206.sh # command line run for 2
							 # please check correctness of relative file path
							 # input (reference genomes) are also included here
3. BFAC_summary_20131206.r # produce summary stats

# data
#------------------------------------------------------------
1. simdata contains simulated data with MetaSim,
	NC_mixed_005363_010473-454.fna is a 10000 reads 
	with 5000 from Ecoli and 5000 from Bdello with 454 error model.
	Average length of reads ~200 bp
2. Bdellovibrio_bacteriovorus_HD100_uid61595, 
	Escherichia_coli_K_12_substr__DH10B_uid58979
	Escherichia_coli_K_12_substr__MDS42_uid193705 contains reference genomes
	for three types of bacteria
3. NC_005363.1.obj, NC_010473.1.obj, and NC_020518.1.obj are bloom filters 
	built for the reference genomes in 2, 
	which are output from BFAC_build_20131206.pl
4. matchscores from querying three bloom filters 
	with reads in NC_mixed_005363_010473-454.fna,
	output from BFAC_query_20131206.pl
